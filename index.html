	<h2>A funny story whith my bird when I was 6</h2>
	<section>
		<p class="header">I had a Bluebird when I was 6 years old. I dont remmember its nameðŸ˜…. One day I was holding the bird and I threw it up for it to fly but intead it hit the sealing and fell down but I catched it at the last second or it could have died. The bird couldn't fly but I always wanted it to fly in the house so I thought if would take it outside and throw it it might start flying. I threw it as hard as i could up in the air but of course it didn't do what i was expecting it to do so after i threw it i can see it coming down and trying to fly but it hit the ground and when i went to see it it was out.</p>
